## Workflow Rules (STRICT ENFORCEMENT)

### 10-Phase State Machine

```
idle → prd_creation → wireframe → wireframe_review → branch_creation
     → prd_splitting → implementation → pr_submission → pr_review → completion → idle
```

### Phase Transition Rules

1. **NEVER skip a phase.** If user asks to skip, respond: "I cannot skip phases. Current phase: [PHASE]. Required gate: [GATE]."
2. **NEVER create a feature branch before wireframe approval.**
3. **NEVER start implementation before service PRDs exist.**
4. **NEVER modify develop/development branch directly.** All work happens on feature branches.
5. **CHECK `.workflow-state.json` before ANY work.**
6. **UPDATE `.workflow-state.json` after every phase transition.**

### Gate Conditions

| Transition | Gate | Check Method |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| prd_creation → wireframe | PRD file exists with required frontmatter + sections | File check |
| wireframe → wireframe_review | Wireframe directory exists with ≥1 .tsx file | File check |
| wireframe_review → branch_creation | Approval recorded (verbal confirmation from Jeff) | Manual confirmation |
| branch_creation → prd_splitting | Feature branch exists from latest develop | Git check |
| prd_splitting → implementation | Service PRDs exist for each touched service | File check |
| implementation → pr_submission | Track file shows progress | File check |
| pr_submission → pr_review | PR URL recorded and exists on GitHub | `gh` check |
| pr_review → completion | PR merged | `gh` check |
| completion → idle | Track file marked complete | File check |

### Context Switching

- Use `/workflow switch <feature-slug>` to switch between active features
- Each feature maintains its own phase independently
- When switching, the agent saves current state, loads target feature's state, and prompts for branch switch if needed

### Team Member Handoff

When picking up another person's feature:
1. Use `/workflow resume <slug>`
2. Agent scans committed artifacts to reconstruct the phase
3. Agent populates local `.workflow-state.json` with reconstructed state
4. Continue from where the previous person left off

### Multiple Wireframes per PRD

- `wireframes` is an array — a PRD can have multiple wireframes
- Each wireframe has its own `slug`, `owner`, and `approval` status
- `wireframe_review` gate requires ALL wireframes to be approved
- Only the wireframe owner (or unassigned) can create/edit a wireframe

### Always Ask Before Executing

**MANDATORY for every agent:** Before performing ANY action:
1. **Explain** what you plan to do and why
2. **Ask questions** if anything is unclear — **use the ask tool** (see below)
3. **Give suggestions** if there are multiple valid approaches
4. **Wait for user confirmation** before executing

**Use the ask tool for ALL user input.** Do NOT just print questions as plain text. Use your tool's dedicated ask mechanism:
- **Claude Code:** `AskUserQuestion` tool with structured options
- **Cursor:** Built-in ask question tool
- **OpenCode:** Question tool with select/text modes

This ensures the agent blocks until the user responds and prevents accidentally proceeding without input.

NEVER execute code changes without explaining the plan first.
NEVER make assumptions about requirements without asking.
NEVER skip the confirmation step, even for "obvious" actions.
NEVER auto-proceed after presenting a plan — always wait for explicit approval.

### Steps requiring sudo or external terminal

Some steps (Nix installation, system config changes, etc.) require `sudo` or an interactive terminal that the agent cannot provide. For these:

1. **Tell the user exactly what to run** in a separate terminal
2. **Use the ask tool** to ask if they've completed it
3. **DO NOT proceed** until user confirms — use the ask tool to block
4. **Verify** the step actually worked (e.g., `command -v nix`) before moving on
5. If verification fails, ask again — do NOT skip the step
