## Workflow Rules (STRICT ENFORCEMENT)

### 11-Phase State Machine

```
idle → prd_creation → wireframe → wireframe_pr → wireframe_review → branch_creation
     → prd_splitting → implementation → pr_submission → pr_review → completion → idle
```

### Phase Transition Rules

1. **NEVER skip a phase.** If user asks to skip, respond: "I cannot skip phases. Current phase: [PHASE]. Required gate: [GATE]."
2. **NEVER create a feature branch before wireframe PR is merged.**
3. **NEVER start implementation before service PRDs exist.**
4. **NEVER modify develop/development branch directly.** Wireframes go on `wireframe/<worker>/vc-<slug>` branch, features on `feature/<worker>/vc-<slug>` branch.
5. **CHECK `.workflow-state.json` before ANY work.**
6. **UPDATE `.workflow-state.json` after every phase transition.**
7. **CHECK current git branch matches the expected branch for the phase** before doing any work.

### Branch per Phase

| Phase | Expected Branch |
|-------|----------------|
| prd_creation | any (PRDs are in docs/, not branch-specific) |
| wireframe | `wireframe/<worker>/vc-<slug>` (created from develop) |
| wireframe_pr | `wireframe/<worker>/vc-<slug>` (PR targets develop) |
| wireframe_review | `wireframe/<worker>/vc-<slug>` (waiting for PR merge) |
| branch_creation | `develop` → creates `feature/<worker>/vc-<slug>` |
| prd_splitting → completion | `feature/<worker>/vc-<slug>` |

### Gate Conditions

| Transition | Gate | Check Method |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| prd_creation → wireframe | PRD file exists with required frontmatter + sections | File check |
| wireframe → wireframe_pr | Wireframe dir exists with .tsx + metadata.json, changes committed on `wireframe/<worker>/vc-<slug>` | File + Git check |
| wireframe_pr → wireframe_review | Wireframe PR exists targeting develop | `gh` check |
| wireframe_review → branch_creation | Wireframe PR merged + Jeff approved | `gh` check + Manual confirmation |
| branch_creation → prd_splitting | On `develop`, pulled latest, wireframe files verified, `feature/<worker>/vc-<slug>` created | Git check |
| prd_splitting → implementation | Service PRDs exist, on `feature/<worker>/vc-<slug>` | File + Git check |
| implementation → pr_submission | Track file shows progress, on `feature/<worker>/vc-<slug>` | File + Git check |
| pr_submission → pr_review | PR URL recorded and exists on GitHub | `gh` check |
| pr_review → completion | PR merged | `gh` check |
| completion → idle | Track file marked complete | File check |

### Context Switching

- Use `/workflow switch <feature-slug>` to switch between active features
- Each feature maintains its own phase independently
- When switching, the agent saves current state, loads target feature's state, and prompts for branch switch if needed

### Team Member Handoff

When picking up another person's feature:
1. Use `/workflow resume <slug>`
2. Agent scans committed artifacts to reconstruct the phase
3. Agent populates local `.workflow-state.json` with reconstructed state
4. Continue from where the previous person left off

### Wireframes and Sub-Pages

A wireframe = **one feature page**. Sub-views (create form, detail page, wizard steps) are sub-pages within the same wireframe directory, not separate wireframes.

- `wireframes` is an array, but most PRDs have **one wireframe** with sub-pages inside it
- Each wireframe has its own `slug`, `owner`, and `approval` status
- `wireframe_review` gate requires ALL wireframes to be approved
- Only the wireframe owner (or unassigned) can create/edit a wireframe
- Do NOT create separate wireframes for sub-views — a "Create" page is a sub-page of the listing wireframe, not its own wireframe
- Multiple wireframes per PRD is rare — only when the PRD describes truly independent feature pages

### Always Ask Before Executing

**MANDATORY for every agent:** Before performing ANY action:
1. **Explain** what you plan to do and why
2. **Ask questions** if anything is unclear — **use the ask tool** (see below)
3. **Give suggestions** if there are multiple valid approaches
4. **Wait for user confirmation** before executing

**Use the ask tool for ALL user input.** Do NOT just print questions as plain text. Use your tool's dedicated ask mechanism:
- **Claude Code:** `AskUserQuestion` tool with structured options
- **Cursor:** Built-in ask question tool
- **OpenCode:** Question tool with select/text modes

This ensures the agent blocks until the user responds and prevents accidentally proceeding without input.

NEVER execute code changes without explaining the plan first.
NEVER make assumptions about requirements without asking.
NEVER skip the confirmation step, even for "obvious" actions.
NEVER auto-proceed after presenting a plan — always wait for explicit approval.

### Steps requiring sudo or external terminal

Some steps (Nix installation, system config changes, etc.) require `sudo` or an interactive terminal that the agent cannot provide. For these:

1. **Tell the user exactly what to run** in a separate terminal
2. **Use the ask tool** to ask if they've completed it
3. **DO NOT proceed** until user confirms — use the ask tool to block
4. **Verify** the step actually worked (e.g., `command -v nix`) before moving on
5. If verification fails, ask again — do NOT skip the step
